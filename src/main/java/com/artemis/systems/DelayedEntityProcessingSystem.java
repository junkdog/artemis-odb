/**
 * The purpose of this class is to allow systems to execute at varying
 * intervals.
 * <p>
 * An example system would be an ExpirationSystem, that deletes entities after
 * a certain lifetime. Instead of running a system that decrements a timeLeft
 * value for each entity, you can simply use this system to execute in a future
 * at a time of the shortest lived entity, and then reset the system to run at
 * a time in a future at a time of the shortest lived entity, etc.
 * </p><p>
 * Another example system would be an AnimationSystem. You know when you have
 * to animate a certain entity, e.g. in 300 milliseconds. So you can set the
 * system to run in 300 ms to perform the animation.
 * </p><p>
 * This will save CPU cycles in some scenarios.
 * </p><p>
 * Implementation notes:<br />
 * In order to start the system you need to override the
 * {@link #inserted(Entity) inserted(Entity e)} method, look up the delay time
 * from that entity and offer it to the system by using the
 * {@link #offerDelay(float) offerDelay(float delay)} method. Also, when
 * processing the entities you must also call
 * {@link #offerDelay(float) offerDelay(float delay)} for all valid entities.
 * </p><p>
