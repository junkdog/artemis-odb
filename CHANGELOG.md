## Change Log (we do our best to adhere to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/))


#### Version: 2.2.0-SNAPSHOT
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - Web backend upgraded to GWT `2.8.0`
  - Serialization modules that depend on libGDX now require `1.9.8`.
  - To enable fluid entities in your world, best practice register `FluidEntityPlugin` instead of `SuperMapper`.

- `World` instances can now inject themselves (`World::inject`)
- Fluid entities quality of life changes.
  - `FluidEntityPlugin` generated as part of the fluid generation process.
  - Added `FluidIteratingSystem`.
  - Annotation driven aspects. Add @All, @Exclude, @One to BaseEntitySystem subclass to use.
  - Generate class C containing all fluid component class literals. (not usable in annotations, sorry).
  - Convenience methods to find entities:
    - by group `for ( E e : E.withGroup("enemy") ) { .. }`
    - by tag `E player = E.withTag("player");`
    - by aspect `for ( E e : E.withAspect(Aspect.all(Pickup.class, Pos.class)) ) { .. }`
    - by component `for ( E e : E.withComponent(Pickup.class) ) { .. }`
  - Allow plugins for fluid interface generation.
    - Override type handling via FieldProxyStrategy. (Want extra methods for LibGDX's `Pos2`? Now you can!)
   

#### Version: 2.1.0 - 2016-12-09
- Opt-in [Fluid Entities API][fluid], convenient way to assemble and interact with
  your entities, making code less verbose, improving readability.
- Entity templates using [Prefabs](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki/Prefabs).
- Wasteful memory allocation during deserialization under control.
- Added `EntitySubscription::removeSubscriptionListener`.
- **Fix**: IOException when serializing to json and prettyPrint is `false`

#### Version: 2.0.0 - 2016-08-15
same as RC6

#### Version: 2.0.0-RC6 - 2016-08-09
- **Fix**: `IntBag::get(index)`, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException reported size of backing array, not logical size.
- **Fix**: Possible IOOB exception when registering more than 64 systems.
- **Fix**: EntityLinkManager/LinkListener::onLinkKilled never fired for unestablished links.


#### Version: 2.0.0-RC5 - 2016-07-23
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - All usage of BitSet replaced by [BitVector][bitvector].

- **BitVector**: custom bitset implementation, generally faster than `java.util.BitSet`.
  - [Optimized][bv-jmh] decoding of bits to integers, making all entity
    mutations more efficient.
  - `unsafeGet`, `unsafeSet`, `unsafeClear` require that the underlying
    array can contain the bit index.
  - `BitVector::ensureCapacity(int bits)` explicitly grows the bit vector.
    Typically used together with the `unsafe-` methods.
  - `EntityManager::registerEntityStore(BitVector)` - when representing
    entity id:s as bits, makes `unsafe-` methods safe - as the `EntityManager`
    grows the bit vector as necessary.
- **Fix**: Bag and IntBag equals method would return false for identical bags with different capacities.

#### Version: 2.0.0-RC4 - 2016-07-10
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - Removed previously deprecated code, see: [5de377d][5de377d].
  - **`InvocationStrategy`** - affectes custom implementations:
    - bag-of-systems now stored as a field, instead of being passed as a parameter
      to `InvocationStrategy::process`
    - `InvocationStrategy::updateEntityStates` must be called before processing the first system.
      Previously, the initial update was done by the world instance.

- `ComponentManager::compositionIdentity(BitSet)` now public.
- `@AspectDescriptor` now also valid on Archetypes.
- `EntityLinkManager` fires events for initial entities when registering a LinkListener;
  toggleable in constructor.

#### Version: 2.0.0-RC3 - 2016-06-21
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - World's systems array is now typed with `BaseSystem`; this should only have
    implication for custom implementations of `SystemInvocationStrategy`.
  - EntityFactory annotation processor and related classes have been removed,
    for more background, see [#428](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/issues/427#issuecomment-217629020).

- AspectFieldResolver; additional default injection field resolver
  - `@AspectDescriptor` on appropriate fields to inject
  - Valid targets: `Aspect`, `Aspect.Builder`, `EntityTransmuter`, `EntitySubscription`
- add `EntityTransmuter(World, Aspect.Builder)` constructor
- Deserialization exception reports on missing component identifiers (usually from
  manually edited json).
- **Fix**: WorldConfigurationBuilder.Priority didn't compare properly.
- **Fix**: thread safefty; InjectionCache's fields no longer static.


#### Version: 2.0.0-RC2 - 2016-05-26
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - Components require a public no-args constructor. While this was allowed in past versions,
    it never worked with serialization or pooled components.

- `World#compositionId(entityId)` added. Previously, one had to go
  via `Entity#getCompositionId()`
- `EntityManager#reset` - if the world is empty, resets entity id generation to `0`
- Optimized entity subscriptions: compositionId pre-calculated and bundled
  by `AspectSubscriptionManager` before informing listeners.
- **Fix**: ComponentMapper was accidentally marked as final in RC1.


#### Version: 2.0.0-RC1 - 2016-05-09
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - Methods added to interface `Injector#getRegistered(Class|String)`
  - `ComponentMapper#getSafe` deprecated, `#get` is sufficient for all use-cases now.
    due to mappers always growing their backing arrays to accomodate the highest entity id.
  - Calling `BaseSystem#process` will now run the system, even if `setEnabled(false)` has been called.
    `SystemInvocationStrategy` now tracks which systems are enabled/disabled.
    (you may want to update your custom `SystemInvocationStrategy` implementations).
  - Bag#getData throws ClassCastException when container wasn't created with any of the
    typed constructors. 

- Optional manager: **[EntityLinkManager][ELM]**, discovery and maintenance of relationships between entities.
  - Automatically tracks component fields: `@EntityId int`, `Entity`, `@EntityId IntBag`, `Bag<Entity>`
    (shares behavior with serialization).
  - `LinkListener` for listening in on when links between entities are established, changed or disconnected.
  - Tune behavior with `@LinkPolicy`, applied on component fields referencing entities.
  - Optimized link accessors via maven/gradle plugin - reflection-based fallback during development.
- [`@DelayedComponentRemoval`][DCR] guarantees that component is available in `SubscriptionListener#removed(IntBag)`.
- `World#getRegistered`, retrieves injectable objects programmatically.
- Re-worked `EntityEdit` logic, less code and more performance.
- ComponentType validates component when first encountered.
- Removed `PackedComponent` and `@PackedWeaver`.
- added `AspectSubscriptionManager#getSubscriptions`
- added `Bag(Class<T>)` and `Bag(Class<T>, int capacity)`
- `IntBag#get` throws `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` whenever `index` is greater than the reported size,
  regardless of the size of the underlying array.
- All systems are first injected, after which all systems are initialized. Previously,
  each system was injected/initialized at the same time.
- **Serialization**
  - new `artemis-odb-serializer` artifact, used by all serialization backends,
  - Kryo serialization backend: [binary with kryo](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki/Kryo-Serialization)
    (thanks to @piotr-j).

#### Version: 1.4.0 - 2016-03-09
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - If you have overridden default injection functionality and instance FieldHandler
    yourself, be aware the FieldHandler constructor behaviour has changed. See below.

- **Fix**: `IntervalEntitySystem#getIntervalDelta` sometimes returned wrong value when interval < `world.delta`.
- **Fix**: Transmuting deleted entities throws an exception, mirroring `EntityEdit`` on deleted.
- **Fix**: Simultaneous transmute + delete caused dead entities in `SubscriptionListener#inserted`.
- **Fix**: Using custom FieldHandler or FieldResolver disabled @Wire on fields.
  - Warn if attempting to inject custom objects without prerequisite resolver (PojoFieldResolver).


#### Version: 1.3.1 - 2015-12-29
- **Fix**: During deserialization, indirectly referenced entities were not included in
  the archetypes section


#### Version: 1.3.0 - 2015-12-28
- **Serialization**
  - Archetypes recorded in output; somewhat smaller output and faster load.
  - If `JsonArtemisSerializer#setUsePrototypes` is true (default), omit components made
    up of default values.
  - Json DOM was parsed multiple times, fixed.
  - Overloaded JsonArtemisSerializer#load - deserialize directly from JsonValue.
  - When loading entities, each deserialized child is assigned an entity id greater
    than its parent.
  - added `WorldSerializationManager#getSerializer` (if you need to load JsonValue directly, for instance)
- **Fix**: Work-around for a NPE during weaving; occurred when trying to inspect fields belonging to any parent class


#### Version: 1.2.1 - 2015-11-23
- **Fix**: `@PooledWeaver` properly resets primitives and strings back to initial values.
- **Fix**: Entity edit right after delete could cause entities to show up in subscription insertions.


#### Version: 1.2.0 - 2015-11-08
- ComponentMappers are reused when injected or when retrieved via `World#getMapper`.
- Deprecated `EntityEdit#deleteEntity`, use `World#delete` or `Entity#deleteFromWorld` instead.
- **Fix**: `@Wire` registered classes would silently fail when not registered.
- **Fix**: Woven pooled components didn't null strings on reset.
- **Fix**: EntityTransmuter cause entities to lose any pending deletes.


#### Version: 1.1.2 - 2015-10-27
- **Fix**: entities having more than one tag.


#### Version: 1.1.1 - 2015-10-25
- **Fix**: New entity subscriptions could end up with an initial batch of dead entities.


#### Version: 1.1.0 - 2015-10-24
- `@PooledWeaver` clears Bag, IntBag, all Lists, Sets, Maps in java.util, all
  Arrays and Maps in libgdx. 
- Serialization: named entities; like tags, but local to the SaveFileFormat instance.
  - Register entities using `com.artemis.components.SerializationTag`.
- Serialization: new setUsePrototypes method, writes default values.
- **Fix**: Deleted entities could still linger in the TagManager.
- **Fix**: Serializing an entity field having a value of `null` or `-1` no longer throws an exception.


#### Version: 1.0.1 - 2015-10-03
- **Fix**: Optimized IteratingSystems were only partially rewritten. Crash on ART.

- Serialization: Removed component key integer prefix in json.
  - In case of collisions, adds an integer suffix to the key name.
- New `ArtemisPlugin` API
- New `WorldConfigurationBuilder` convenience class.
- Added `World.edit(int entityId)`
- Added `World.create()`, returns int entityId
- Managers' inserted/removed passes Entity, again.
- EntitySystem extends BaseEntitySystem, new BaseEntitySystems work directly on entityId:
  - `IteratingSystem`: `EntityProcessingSystem`.
  - `IntervalSystem` and `IntervalIteratingSystem`: `IntervalEntity*System`
  - `DelayedIteratingSystem`: `DelayedEntityProcessingSystem`
- `IteratingSystem` eligible for compile-time optimizations, like EntityProcessingSystem.
- By convention, `@Wire` is now implied on all systems and managers. Use `@SkipWire` to suppress.
- new `IntBag` methods: addAll, removeValue.
- Dropped EntityObserver methods taking single entityId.
- Removed flyweight entities
  - No more bugs due to escaping flyweights.

#### Version: 0.13.1 - 2015-09-20
- **Fix**: Deleted entities no longer mess up subscriptions when edited in `SubscriptionListener#removed`.
- **Fix**: Deleted entities retain components.


#### Version: 0.13.0 - 2015-09-14
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - `World#getEntity(int)` can return inactive Entities, check state using `Entity#isActive` or
     `EntitityManager.isActive(int)`.
  - `Entity.isActive` no longer works for checking whether an entity was just created, instead
    use `EntityManager#isNew(int)`.

- New additional serialization backend: [json via libgdx](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki/libgdx-jso).
  - **GWT support**, works with libgdx's HTML5 backend.
  - Supports more libgdx classes out of the box.
- New `artemis-odb-debug` artifact
  - Replaces normal artemis-odb with this (remove artemis-odb from pom/gradle/IDE)
  - Performs extra runtime checks; tries to catch run-away flyweights.
  - Incurs a rather hefty performance penalty.
- **Fix**: SubscriptionListeners#removed ids resolved to a lot of nulls.


#### Version: 0.12.1 - 2015-09-05
- **Fix**: IntDeque resets beginIndex when growing.


#### Version: 0.12.0 - 2015-09-04
- InvocationStrategy configurable via WorldConfiguration. 
- Add @SkipWire annotation to exclude injection targets.
- Entities recycled in FIFO order.
- Change EntitySubscription order to deleted/added/changed.
- Change AspectSubscription order to removed/inserted.
- **FIX**: Resolved potential "markSupported() is undefined for the type InputStream" message when
  compiling for GWT.


#### Version: 0.11.4 - 2015-08-18
- **Fix**: Excessive object creation when serializing entities.
- **Fix**: Components referencing other entities are implicitly included when serializing.
- **Fix**: SaveFileFormat should only enumerate required components.


#### Version: 0.11.3 - 2015-08-14
- **Fix**: entity reference operations could fail when loading into a fresh World instance.


#### Version: 0.11.2 - 2015-08-11
- Added boolean `WorldSerializationManager#alwaysLoadStreamMemory`, forces fully loading the stream into
  memory during loading, even if stream reports that `mark` is supported. Necessary when working
  with libgdx's FileHandles.
  - Enabled by default.
- **Fix**: Duplicate ComponentNameComparator in json module, causing failing android builds.

#### Version: 0.11.1 - 2015-08-11
- **Fix**: Entities not registered as added to world *during* batch entity synchronization.


#### Version: 0.11.0 - 2015-08-10
- **BREAKING CHANGES**
  - EntitySubscription's inserted/removed method pass an IntBag
    of entity ids, instead of a Bag of entities.
  - EntityObserver's methods pass entity id.

#### Version: 0.10.1 - 2015-07-20
- **Fix**: Reduced visibility of AspectionSubscriptionManager constructor.
- **Fix**: NPE related to `EntitySubscription#createSubscription`.


#### Version: 0.10.0 - 2015-07-19
- **MINOR BREAKING CHANGES**
  - BaseSystem is now the most basic system type.
    - World#getSystems returns Bag<BaseSystem>.
  - EntitySystem constructor expects Aspect.Builder:
    - Implies existing classes have to be recompiled against this release.
	- Existing custom entity systems need to pass Aspect.Builder to EntitySystem.
  - EntitySystem no longer implements EntityObserver.
  - ArtemisProfiler#initialize now requires BaseSystem instead of EntitySystem.
  - VoidEntitySystem no longer subclass of EntitySystem.
  - **`setSystem`** and **`setManager`** now under `WorldConfiguration`. This
    effectively removes `World#initialize`, as initializations happens inside
	World's constructor.

- New internal EntitySubscription and accompanying AspectSubscriptionManager
  resulting in cleaner and more flexible EntitySystems.
- SystemInvocationStrategy opening up for more granular control over system  processing.
  - Default strategy behaves as before.
- Aspect split into Aspect and Aspect.Builder.
  - Simplified static method names, mirroring Aspect's old instance methods.
- EntityFactories support for enum values.
- Children of EntitySystems can create flyweight entities.
- **Fix**: Uninitialized worlds threw cryptic NPE when invoking #process.
- **Fix**: `World#createFactory(Class<EntityFactory>)` was package local.
- **Fix**: `Entity#edit` used together with EntityTransmuters or Archetypes
  caused the wrong compositionId to be reported, if all changes took place
  during the same processing round..

#### Version: 0.9.0 - 2015-02-03
- **MINOR BREAKING CHANGES**
  - Entity instances should never be compared by reference equality; always do
    `entity1.equals(entity2)`.
  - It is no longer valid to add additional managers or systems to initialized worlds.

- MundaneWireException thrown by World#inject if class lacks @Wire.
  Previously, it silently failed to inject.
- Systems' entity iteration speed slightly faster.
- New EntityTransmuter class, an alternative but more efficient way of adding/removing
  components.
- Optimized entity removal speed. 
- Adding and removing existing entities from systems is now considerably faster.
- Add enablePackedWeaving to maven, gradle and CLI tool.
- Reduced EntitySystem memory footprint by 2/3.
- **Fix**: Entity systems can now subscribe to all entities when aspect is empty.
- **Fix**: EntityFactory annotation processor sometimes failed generating the
  factory implementation when running from within Eclipse.

#### Version: 0.8.1 - 2014-11-10
- CLI command for configuring eclipse projects with annotation processor (entity factories)
- **Fix**: Adding a component to an archetyped entity prior to it being added to the world
  resulted in the component never being registered.
  - Note that editing an entity created by an archetype voids the performance benefit of archetypes..

#### Version: 0.8.0 - 2014-10-20
- **MINOR BREAKING CHANGES**
  - Archetype moved to `com.artemis` package.

- Auto-generate [EntityFactories](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki/EntityFactory).
- ArchetypeBuilder constructor accepts null passed as parent.

#### Version: 0.7.2 - 2014-10-08
- **Fix**: Chaining Entity#edit caused the internal bitset to reset
  between component removals.

#### Version: 0.7.1 - 2014-09-24
- Gradle plugin for bytecode weaving. See [Weave Automation](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki/Weave-Automation)
- Faster removal of components.

#### Version: 0.7.0 - 2014-09-21

- **MINOR BREAKING CHANGES**
  - Entity state changes aren't reflected until the next system starts processing
    or a new `World#process` round begins, whichever comes first. 
  - Removed initial parameter (type) from Aspect methods; this changes the method
    descriptor, requiring any project to be recompiled.

- The GWT backend can now read values off annotations.
- **Bytecode optimizations:** (invoked via maven plugin or the CLI tool)
  - [Automatically optimize entity processing systems](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki/Optimizing-Entity-Systems).
  - `@PackedWeaver` components no longer overwrite data in multi-World scenarios.
- Removed `artemis-benchmark`, refer to [entity-system-benchmarks](https://github.com/junkdog/entity-system-benchmarks) instead.
- It's no longer necessary to call `Entity#changedInWorld` and `Entity#addToWorld`
  - Use `Entity#edit` when adding or removing components.
- **Adding and removing entities to systems is now approximately 150% faster**.
  - Entity compositions are no longer primarily identified by BitSets, but instead
    have a compositionId - EntitySystems track which composition ids are of interest.
  - `ArchetypeBuilder` and `Archetype` precalculates compositionId, allowing for greatly increased
    insertion performance.
  - Optimized `EntitySystem#check`, entities are processed in bulk, less checks when removing entities,
    removed systemIndex.
- [@Profile](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/wiki/@Profile) entity systems with custom classes.
- New WorldConfiguration class
  - Set expected entity count
  - Limit number of rebuilt active entities per system/tick. Rebuilt indices ensure entities are
    processed in sequential order.
- New interface `PackedComponent.DisposedWithWorld` for freeing packed components' resources when
  disposing the world.
  - Automatically added to all `@PackedWeaver` components.
- `World#inject(Object)` can inject normal java classes with artemis types.
  - Requires that the injected object is annotated with `@Wire`
- Less bounds checking for PackedComponents.
- Added `World#getManagers` method.
- Lots of methods now deprecated
  - These will be removed when 1.0.0 is released.
  - See the `@deprecated` notice for how things work in the new world.
- maven plugin registered as "artemis-odb", ie `mvn artemis-odb:matrix`, or `mvn artemis-odb:artemis`
- **Fix**: `@PooledWeaver` wasn't resetting components.
  - Additionaly, only primitive fields are reset - objects are left intact.
- **Fix**: `EntityManager#getActiveEntityCount` could report the wrong number if entities were
  deleted before having been added to the world.
- **Fix**: Disabled entities are no longer added to systems.
- **Fix**: `EntityManager#isActive` could throw an OOB exception..
- **FIX**: Possible IOOB in `@PackedWeaver` components when accessing component data.

#### Version: 0.6.5 - 2014-07-17
- Better support for multiple concurrent worlds in regards to memory usage.
- Smaller entity instances.
- **Fix**: Actually fixed GWT support, bumped gwt to 2.6.0.

#### Version: 0.6.3 - 2014-07-07
- **Fix**: Potential IOOB exceptions in UuidEntityManager.

#### Version: 0.6.2 - 2014-07-07
- UUID is now optional for entities.
  - Add UuidEntityManager to automatically map UUID:s to entities.
  - UUID:s are lazily instantiated.
- **Fix**: GWT build was broken in 0.6.1.

#### Version: 0.6.1 - 2014-07-03
- New standalone `artemis-odb-cli` artifact:
  - Handles weaving (new in 0.6.1) and matrix generation.
  - Replaces `artemis-odb-matrix-X.Y.Z-cli.jar`.
- **Fix**: OOB Exception in ComponentManager with componentsByType when component types > 64.
- **Fix**: Calling `Entity#changedInWorld` before an entity is added to the world yields null.

#### Version: 0.6.0 - 2014-06-01
- **GWT support** ([demo](http://flet.github.io/spaceship-warrior-redux/)) sporting
  [libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx)'s reflection wrapper code.
  - This means that `@Mapper` and `@Wire` works for GWT builds too.
  - Note: `@PooledWeaver` and `@PackedWeaver` don't work under GWT, though the presence
    of the annotations doesn't break anything.
- Automatically generate a bird's eye view of artemis: **[Component Dependency Matrix][CDM]**.
- **Faux structs** with [@PackedWeaver][Struct]`.
  - Looks and behaves just like normal java classes.
  - Direct field access works - no need to generate getters and setters - i.e. `position.x += 0.24f` is valid.
  - Contiguously stored in memory, internally backed by a shared `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect()`.
  - Works for all components composed of primitive types.
- Entity systems and managers can `@Wire` (inject) anything from the world: will eventually
  replace `@Mapper`. No need to annotate each field - just annotate the class and artemis
  will take care of injecting applicable fields.
  - `@Wire` can inject parent classes too.
  - `@Wire` can resolve non-final references. Eg, AbstractEntityFactory is resolved as
    EntityFactory etc. See [test/example](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/blob/6eb51ccc7a72a4ff16737277f609a58f9cae94ca/artemis/src/test/java/com/artemis/SmarterWireTest.java#L39).
- EntitySystems process entities in ascending id order.
  - Considerably faster processing when memory access is aligned (potential biggest gains from
    PackedComponents).
  - Slightly slower insert/remove (3-4% with 4096 entities)
- New optional `UuidEntityManager`, tracks entities by UUID.
- Optional `expectedEntityCount` parameters in `World` constructor.
- `-DideFriendlyPacking`: If true, will leave field stubs to keep IDE:s 
  happy after transformations. Defaults to false.
- `-DenablePooledWeaving`: Enables weaving of pooled components (more viable on
  Android than JVM). Defaults to true.
- `-DenableArtemisPlugin`: If set to false, no weaving will take place (useful
  for debugging).
- **Fix**: Possible NPE when removing recently created entities.
- **Fix**: `Entity#getComponent` would sometimes throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

#### Version: 0.5.0 - 2013-11-24
 - Changed artemis to a multi-module project (the `artemis` folder is the old root).
 - Entity instances are recycled.
 - New component types, `PooledComponent` and `PackedComponent`.
   - Optionally transform components with `@PackedWeaver` and `@PooledWeaver` by
     configuring the `artemis-odb-maven-plugin`.
 - New method `Entity#createComponent(Class<Component>)`.
 - Annotation processor validates pooled and packed component types.
 - Managers support `@Mapper` annotation.
 - No longer necessary to stub `Manager#initialize()`.
 - `GroupManager#getGroups` returns an empty bag if entity isn't in any group.
 - `World#dispose` for disposing managers and systems with managed resources.
 - **Fix**: DelayedEntityProcessingSystem prematurely expired entities.
 - **Fix**: Recycled entities would sometimes have their components cleared when
   recycled during the same round as the original entity was deleted.
 - **Fix**: GroupManager avoids duplicate entities and removes them upon deletion.
