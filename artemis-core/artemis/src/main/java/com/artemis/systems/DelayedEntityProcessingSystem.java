/**
 * Tracks cooldown per entity, processing entity when its timer runs out.
 * <p>
 * An example system would be an ExpirationSystem, that deletes entities after
 * a certain lifetime. Instead of running a system that decrements a timeLeft
 * value for each entity, you can simply use this system to execute in a future
 * at a time of the shortest lived entity, and then reset the system to run at
 * a time in a future at a time of the shortest lived entity, etc.
 * </p><p>
 * Another example system would be an AnimationSystem. You know when you have
 * to animate a certain entity, e.g. in 300 milliseconds. So you can set the
 * system to run in 300 ms to perform the animation.
 * </p><p>
 * This will save CPU cycles in some scenarios.
 * </p><p>
 * Implementation notes:<br />
 * Within {@link #processExpired(Entity) processExpired(Entity e)}
 * you must call {@link #offerDelay(float) offerDelay(float delay)} if the
 * entity's delay time is renewed. That method is also called by {@link #inserted(int) inserted(int entityId)}
 * for each newly matched entity.
